PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This Excel project offers an in-depth analysis of a dataset that details information about bike buyers. The process includes data cleaning, transformation, the creation of pivot tables, and visualization of the data. The final product is a dynamic dashboard with slicers, allowing users to filter data by marital status, region, and education level.

REPOSITORY STRUCTURE:
The repository includes the following files:
Bike_Buyers_Analysis.xlsx: The main Excel file with all sheets (raw data, working data, pivot tables, and dashboard).
README.md: This file, which gives an overview and detailed explanation of the project.

EXCEL WORKBOOK STRUCTURE:
The workbook consists of four main sheets:
Bike_Buyers (Sheet 1): Contains the raw dataset.
Working_Sheet (Sheet 2): A duplicate of the raw data where data cleaning was executed. This cleaned data is used for creating pivot tables and visualizations.
Pivot_Tables (Sheet 3): Contains the various pivot tables used for the analysis.
Dashboard (Sheet 4): The dashboard with visualizations and slicers for interactive data exploration.

PIVOT TABLES AND VISUALIZATIONS:
Four pivot tables were created to derive insights:
1. Average Income per Purchase by Gender: Displays the average income of customers who bought bikes, categorized by gender. Visualized with a bar chart.
2. Customer Commute and Bike Purchases: Shows the count of bikes purchased, with commute distance on the X-axis and the number of purchases on the Y-axis. Visualized with a line chart.
3. Bike Purchases by Age Brackets: Categorizes customers into three age brackets (Adolescent, Middle Age, Old) and displays the count of bikes purchased in each bracket. Visualized with a line chart.
4. Bike Purchases by Actual Age: Similar to the third pivot table, but uses actual ages instead of age brackets. Visualized with a line chart.

DASHBOARD:
The dashboard includes:
A bar chart showing average income per purchase by gender.
A line chart showing customer commute with the count of purchased bikes.
A line chart showing the count of purchased bikes by age brackets.
Additionally, slicers for marital status, region, and education were added to enable interactive data filtering.

CONCLUSION:
This project provides insights into bike buyers' purchasing behavior, emphasizing the influence of factors like gender, age, and commute distance. The dynamic dashboard enhances user interaction, making data exploration more intuitive and informative.
